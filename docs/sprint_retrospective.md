# Spirnt Retrospective

## Sprint 0
### 30.04.-14.05

The 0 sprint was used for research into the topic, the technical requirements, implementability and architectural requirements as well as existing software or solutions that could be build upon.

Functional requirements were defined. Technical requirements were partially defined, as no choice has yet been made for the web-app's (G)UI and I was unable to find a solution for dockerizaton. 

It was decided to use the music21 musicology library in combination with MuseScore for the initial release with a potential later use of LaTeX with the byzfonts package for rendered byzantine notation output.  


## Sprint 1
### 14.05.-21.05.
During the string the architecture had to be modified, but the core-functionality (except for fthora and ison) was implemented. 

It is expected, that the ison will be easy to implement, though fthores are expected to require further modifications to the architecture (most likely dealt with by case distinctions and modifications to the scale generation process)
